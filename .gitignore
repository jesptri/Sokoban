# === Object files ===
*.o

# === Executable files without extensions (built by gcc -o <name>) ===
# Ignore all files in the root directory with no extension
# except specific files like Makefile and README
# This matches your 'clean' command in the Makefile:
#   find . -maxdepth 1 -type f ! -name "*.*" ! -name "Makefile" ! -name "README"
# Equivalent Git pattern:
 /[a-zA-Z0-9_-]*

# But keep these explicitly:
!Makefile
!README

# === VS Code configuration directory ===
.vscode/
